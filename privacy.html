        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Updated: March 11, 2014</p>

        <p>Pryvy ("Pryvy") is operated and presented to users in all locations by the Pryvy LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (the “Company”). This Privacy Policy covers use of information collected by the Company. </p>
          <p>We are committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe website and applications for people of all ages. We are dedicated to safeguarding any personal information collected on the Pryvy website (www.pryvy.com) and/or Pryvy applications (collectively, the “Pryvy System”). Our Privacy Policy and our information practices adhere to the United States Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. </p>
  <p>To help ensure a rewarding online experience for our visitors, we provide you with this Privacy Policy that describes the information practices of the Pryvy System Pryvy website (www.pryvy.com) and/or the Pryvy application(s) (collectively, the “System”), including how we collect, use and disclose personal information. </p>
  <p><strong>The Information We Collect</strong>   We require consent from a parent or a legal guardian of a child (a “Parent”) when a child wants to be registered for the Pryvy System. Only a Parent may create a Pryvy account for a child. Unless a Parent creates an account for a child, a child may not use the Pryvy System. A child may initiate the registration process by using the Pryvy System to send an email to the Company with the child’s first name and a valid email address for the child’s Parent. The Pryvy System will then automatically email an invitation to register for the Pryvy System to the Parent without retaining either the child’s name or the Parent’s email address. Alternatively, the Parent can directly initiate the registration process through the Pryvy System. As described in this Privacy Policy, we directly collect information only from the Parent during our initial registration process, including the Parent's email address, the Parent's account name, and the child's password for each registered user under the Parent’s account. When a Pryvy Parent registrant acquires a paid membership, we may collect additional personally identifiable information ("PII") from the Parent. The types of PII that may be collected at that time include the Parent's full name, email address, and credit card (or other payment method) billing information including mailing address. The Pryvy System does not condition a child's participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity. The Pryvy System requires a Parent to provide a valid email address in order to register on the System, and register a child under the Parent's Pryvy account before the child can participate in the Pryvy virtual world by sending or receiving telephone, email or text messages, playing games and viewing content. We use the Parent’s email address to send the Parent a message that can be used to activate the Pryvy account, to notify the Parent about our privacy practices, and to send the Parent communications either about the Parent’s and child’s Pryvy accounts or about features of our Pryvy System, including periodic Parent newsletters about Pryvy, and for such other purposes as described in this Privacy Policy. This email address is correlated with the account user name. With the Parent’s prior permission, we also may use this email address to send the Parent promotional messages regarding Pryvy products and services. The Parent may revoke their permission to receive promotional messages regarding Pryvy at any time by emailing customer support at support@pryvy.com and may unsubscribe from promotional email communications from Pryvy by clicking on unsubscribe links in those emails. We may also request a user name and email address when a user submits a form through the "Contact Us" portion of the Pryvy System so that we may respond to the inquiry. We collect the e-mail address for the sole purpose of responding directly on a one-time basis to a specific inquiry. For some of our online activities - such as polls, surveys, games or contests - we may ask users to provide information that is not personally identifiable, such as country of residence or a user’s favorite color. We also enable users to chat online through our Pryvy System, but only to those Pryvy users you have pre-approved. Nonetheless, if you use the chat function within the Pryvy System and disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected or used by other approved Pryvy users. We strongly encourage you not to disclose personal information (such as real name, email address, telephone number, etc.) about the user or about any third party in such chats and are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit through the chat function. Finally, the System may allow posts of content (but not emails, texts or telephone calls) to be made to non-Pryvy users who have been approved by a childâ€™s Parent, including individuals (e.g. a childâ€™s teacher) or groups (e.g. a childâ€™s classmates or sports team) or other Public Forums (as defined in the Terms of Use governing the Pryvy System (the "Terms of Use")), as well as other features in which you may provide us with Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use). If you use a Public Forum on this Pryvy System, and disclose personally identifiable information is disclosed on the Public Forum, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected or used by non-Pryvy users you have approved. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these Public Forums. Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we may passively collect certain non-personally identifiable computer information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows XP or Mac OS), the user's IP Address and MAC Address, the web browser (e.g., Firefox, Internet Explorer) being used, the frequency with which guests visit various parts of our sites, and information regarding the Internet service provider, in order to make our sites more interesting and useful to you and for various purposes related to our business. We or one of our contractors on our behalf may collect this non-personally identifiable information through the use of software technologies such as unique identifiers or "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn on/off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings.  Please note that most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother, and some of our services may not function properly. Finally, we may collect financial information as set out below. We would use this financial information to process payments to the Company and for fraud prevention purposes. The financial information that you enter to purchase a membership is not stored by the Company, but, instead, is retained by our payments processing vendor who acts on our behalf for the purpose of processing payments made to the Company and for fraud prevention purposes. </p>
  <p><strong>How We Use, Disclose, and Store the Information We Collect</strong>   In addition to the purposes described above, we may actively collect and use email addresses and user names to track usage and to ensure users are following the Pryvy System's Terms of Use. In addition, we may use an email address and user name to ban a user temporarily or permanently from the Pryvy System if that user engages in inappropriate conduct on the site. We may also use email addresses and user names to enable Parents to review PII that the children have submitted to the Pryvy System and to provide notification regarding the site, such as any future amendments to this Privacy Policy. We also may use information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services. We may disclose information where we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena, or where we disclose information to data processors who act on our behalf (service providers or other group companies who provide support for the operations of our Pryvy System and who do not use or disclose the information for any other purpose). To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose PII in response to a law enforcement agency's or other public agency's (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Pryvy System, protect the security or integrity of our System, or enable us to take precautions against liability. If we sell all or part of our business or make a sale or transfer of our assets or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer PII to a third party as part of that transaction, to the extent permitted by applicable law. </p>
  <p><strong>Collection of Information for Third-Party Advertisers and Sponsors</strong>   We do not allow third-party companies to have access to our users' data, though we may use the data to match criteria requested by advertisers and sponsors. </p>
  <p><strong>Security</strong>   The security of your personal information is important to us. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. When you enter sensitive information, such as your credit card number, or our membership subscription form, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).  Wherever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us, we will take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. </p>
  <p><strong>Financial Information</strong>   If a Parent wants to acquire a paid membership in order to access certain content and functionality on the Pryvy System, or to be provided other information, products or services which may be requested, the Parent's full name, email address, credit card billing information including mailing address will be required at the time of purchase. That information is not stored by the Company, and, instead, is stored by our payments processing vendor for the purpose of processing payments made to the Company and for fraud prevention purposes. That information is safeguarded with appropriate security, and it will not be used for other purposes. Furthermore, our payments processing vendor has agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal and financial information it obtains from the Pryvy System, and only to use this information on our behalf. Our financial institution is bound by all applicable privacy laws relating to the provision of financial services. </p>

To protect you and your child's privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting you access to the personal information that we collect and maintain about you or your child. </p>

We will provide notice to you if these changes are material and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. </p>
