        <h1>Pryvy Beta Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>Updated: March 11, 2014</p>

        <p><strong>FIRST, ABOUT OUR SOFTWARE:</strong> </p>
<p>Pryvy utilizes a system of software communications applications, provided to its users via the Internet and mobile applications, whose target audience is young children ages 4 to 12, inclusive, and their parents, in much the same way that other Internet-based products are delivered (such as Yahoo! Mail or Facebook). You don’t need to install any software to use Pryvy; your existing Internet browser is all that is required (although we recommend using updated versions of Chrome during the beta period). You also may download our iPhone and iPad applications through the iTune apps store. 
<p><strong>BETA TESTING DEFINED: </strong></p>
<p>Pryvy is currently in “Beta” testing. This means that we have not yet completed development of Pryvy. Not all features are completely functional or available, and the site may perform slowly at times. In some cases, you may see cryptic error messages filled with computer-speak. And occasionally, the site might not work at all. 
We’re making Pryvy available to you for two reasons: 
  1.  We believe you will find the product useful, even if it’s not perfect  
  2.  We want your feedback!  
It’s important for us to hear from you as you use Pryvy. We want to know what you like, don’t like, and have questions about. We’d like to know how we can make Pryvy as useful as possible for you! Please email us at support@pryvy.com or go to http://help.pryvy.com to make suggestions, share ideas, report problems, or ask a question. In doing so, however, you agree that, in the absence of any written agreement to the contrary, Pryvy will be free to use any feedback you provide for any purpose and you are transferring any right of ownership with respect thereto to us and are waiving any right to compensation with respect thereto. We devote significant time to checking the feedback forum! </p>
 
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL TERMS: </strong></p>
<p>The Pryvy beta product and technical support are provided “as is” without warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p> 
<p>In no event will Pryvy or its owner, Pryvy LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, be liable for any damages related to the use of Pryvy, including but not limited to any lost profits, lost savings, lost data, or any incidental or consequential damages, even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of such damages, or for any claim by you based on a third party claim. 
At this time, Pryvy is a work-in-progress. We reserve the right to make modifications to the product at our discretion, including changing or removing features or functionality. We further reserve the right to remove Pryvy from beta testing at any time or discontinue offering access to Pryvy altogether. 
FINALLY: THANKS FOR USING PRYVY! 
Onward…

<p>KEY POINTS </p>
<p>It is important that you read the entirety of and understand this document. There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasize: 
NO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES: The System is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, the System does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services including, without limitation, to 911 or Operator (0) calls. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed. 
NO OWNERSHIP OF NUMBERS: If the Company allocates to you a Pryvy Number, you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever. We may need to change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time. You will not transfer or attempt to transfer your Pryvy Number to anyone else. You must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements displayed when purchasing a Pryvy as failure to do so could result in the number being withdrawn. Please see also paragraph 24.1. </p>

<p><strong>3. USE OF THE SYSTEM </strong></p>

The Software may use the processing capabilities, memory and bandwidth of the computer (or other applicable device) you are using, for the limited purpose of facilitating the communication and establishing the connection between Software users.

<p>11.3 Promotional Offers: From time to time, Pryvy may offer Paid-For Products for free for a trial period. Pryvy reserves the right to charge you for such Products (at the normal rate) in the event that Pryvy determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other devices or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you. </p>

<p><strong>12. PAYMENT </strong></p>
<p>12.1 Pryvy Credit. You can pay for select Paid-For Products using Pryvy Credit. You can purchase Pryvy Credit using any payment method made available to you by Pryvy from time to time. The Pryvy Credit that you purchase will be credited to your User Account at the time of purchase (or if you are using a Pryvy Credit voucher, at the time you redeem that voucher). </p>
<p>12.2 Inactive Pryvy Credit. If you do not use your Pryvy Credit for a period of 180 days, (including Pryvy Credit that has been allocated to you by a Pryvy Manager administrator) Pryvy will place your Pryvy Credit on inactive status. You can reactivate the Pryvy Credit by following the reactivation link in My Account at https://app.pryvy.com/account/reactivate. Reactivated Pryvy Credit is not refundable. If you are located in Japan and you buy Pryvy Credit from the Pryvy Website, this paragraph does not apply to you and your Pryvy Credit shall expire 6 months from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to use any Pryvy Credit on or after the date of its expiration. </p>
<p>12.3 Other payment methods. Pryvy does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Pryvy Credit balance to purchase all Products. Where Pryvy Credit cannot be used to pay for a Product, Pryvy will make another payment method available to you. Pryvy reserves the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at its sole discretion. </p>
<p>12.4 Recurring Payments. Where you purchase Products on a subscription basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Pryvy by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Product is terminated by you or by Pryvy. </p>
<p>12.5 Auto-Recharge. </p>
(a) If and when it is made available, the Auto-Recharge feature would be automatically enabled when you buy Pryvy Credit, unless you untick the appropriate box. Your Pryvy Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge, unless you subsequently change the amount by accessing your User Account. For example, if you purchase $10.00 of Pryvy Credit with your credit card, the recharge amount charged to your credit card will also be $10.00 of Pryvy Credit. In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your Pryvy account balance goes below the threshold set by Pryvy from time to time. If you do not want to enable Auto-Recharge, please untick the box. 
(b) If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Pryvy Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. 
(c) You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing your User Account. </p>
 
<p><strong>13. REFUND POLICY</strong> </p>
<p>13.1 When you purchase Paid For Products directly from Pryvy you will be entitled to a cancellation period of fifteen (15) days (a “Cooling-Off Period”) unless you have made use of the Paid For Products in any way, in which case the Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded. Refunds on Paid For Products purchased with Pryvy Credit shall only be in Pryvy Credit. </p>
<p>13.2 Outside of the Cooling-Off Period, only subscriptions are refundable unless used or expired. </p>
<p>13.3 Expenditure of Pryvy Credit, allocation of a Pryvy Number, or use of any aspect of a subscription amounts to “use” of a Paid For Product. You hereby expressly agree that Pryvy Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period. </p>
<p>13.4 The Cooling-Off Period and refunds do not apply to Paid For Products that are (i) purchased via a third party partner of Pryvy (please contact the partner directly, who may decide in its sole discretion whether or not to pay a refund), (ii) not directly acquired online from Pryvy (e.g. vouchers) and (iii) paid for and allocated to your Pryvy Account by a Pryvy Manager administrator. </p>
<p>13.5 If you believe that Pryvy has charged you in error, you must contact Pryvy within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. </p>
<p>13.6 Pryvy reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same Product; (ii) if you are in breach of these Terms or (iii) if Pryvy reasonably suspects that you are using our Products or Software fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently. </p>

<p><strong>24. PRODUCT SPECIFIC TERMS</strong></p>
<p>24.1 Pryvy Numbers 
(a) Availability and use. Where we provide you with a Pryvy Number, you agree that: 
(i) you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever; 
(ii) the number provided to you is subject to applicable numbering rules and regulatory practices; 
(iii) you will comply on an ongoing basis with any specific number allocation requirements that we make you aware of, or any reasonable instructions that Pryvy or Pryvy’s partners may give to you with regard to the use of the numbers and the Products; 
(iv) you will not transfer or attempt to transfer your number to any third party. In particular, you are responsible for compliance with any requirements related to residency and or location; and 
(v) you will supply accurate, complete and up-to-date information to us where we request it and inform us where such information changes. The Company reserves the right to change the terms related to Pryvy Numbers, including without limitation to impose or amend any residency requirements and/or require the provision of further user information for continued access to such numbers. In certain countries, a number may be made available to you by a Pryvy partner rather than Pryvy, and you may need to enter into a separate agreement with such partner. 
(b) Other changes to numbers. If Pryvy needs to withdraw or change the number that has been made available to you, Pryvy will use commercially reasonable endeavors to notify you by e-mail, stating the effective date of the change and where possible, your new number. If you do not wish to accept this new number, you are entitled to terminate your number. 
24.2 Subscriptions 
(a) Fair Usage Policy. At Pryvy, we want all of our customers to get the best calling plans we can offer, known as ‘subscriptions’, at the lowest possible price. This Fair Usage Policy ("FUP") is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our subscriptions by a small number of users. 
Subject to this FUP, Pryvy’s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines (and mobiles in certain countries) in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers). The countries included within your subscription are set at the time of original purchase and remain the same upon renewal. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 1-hour duration. 
Pryvy’s subscriptions are for individual use only (personal communications) in accordance with our Terms of Use and this FUP (“Legitimate Use”). The following is a non-exhaustive list of practices that would not be considered Legitimate Use: 
(i) Using subscriptions for telemarketing or call center operations; 
(ii) Re-selling subscription minutes; 
(iii) Sharing subscriptions between users whether via a PBX, call center, computer or any other means; 
(iv) Calling numbers (whether singly, sequentially or automatically) to generate income for yourself or others as a result of merely placing the call; and 
(v) Unusual calling patterns inconsistent with normal, individual subscription use, for example, regular calls of short duration or calls to multiple numbers in a short period of time. 
Other practices may be relevant in determining Legitimate Use and Pryvy reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination. Pryvy may at its option, terminate its relationship with you, or may suspend your subscription immediately if it determines you are using your subscription contrary to this FUP or Pryvy’s terms of use. Where reasonable, Pryvy will provide you with notice of improper usage before suspension or termination of your subscription and, if appropriate, Pryvy may offer you an alternative subscription. 
(b) Pryvy reserves the right to withdraw or change the subscriptions at any time. If Pryvy changes the Products included in your subscription, Pryvy will notify you by email stating the changes and their effective date. If you do not wish to accept these changes, you are entitled to terminate your subscription, with effect from the date on which the changes are due to take effect.</p> 
<p>24.3 SMS </p>
<p>Each SMS message has a limit of 160 characters. If you type a longer message it will be broken down into several SMS messages and you will be charged for each message sent. If you send SMS messages to more than one person you will be charged for each SMS sent to each recipient. If Pryvy cannot (for whatever reason) send your SMS, Pryvy will continue to try and send the message for up to 24 hours after which time the SMS charge will be refunded to your Pryvy Credit balance automatically if delivery is unsuccessful. </p>
<p>24.4 Pryvy Email </p>
<p>To keep our System healthy and your accounts safe, Pryvy limits the amount of mail a user can send. The limits restrict the number of messages sent per day and the number of recipients per message. After reaching one of these limits, a user cannot send new messages but can still access his or her account and receive incoming email. The value of these limits may change without notice in order to protect Pryvy’s infrastructure. </p>
