          <img src="{{site.image_path}}/resources/post-social-dangers.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Social apps like Instagram and Twitter are powerful tools for both good and bad.  On the one hand, they connect us to the world, and allow us to feely share ideas and thoughts.  On the other hand, they put us face-to-face with the dark side of humanity.  </p>
          <p>As adults, we know how to use social media responsibly (most of the time), but kids and young teens aren't mature enough to know how to keep themselves safe or to process the adult content that is pervasive on social sites.</p>
          <p>It's no wonder the mix of kids and social media can have disasterous consequences.  Here are 5 social media dangers that every parent should be aware of:</p>  

          <h2><strong>Constant Contact with Strangers</stong></h2>
          <img src="{{site.image_path}}/resources/post-strangers.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Comment boards, online gaming and video chat all help kids stay connected, but they also put kids in direct contact with total strangers.</p>

          <h2><strong>Profanity & Aggression</stong></h2>
          <img src="{{site.image_path}}/resources/post-profanity.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Kids make mistakes all the time, and even saying something jokingly can permenantly damage your child's future.</p>

          <h2><strong>Bullying is now a constant torment</stong></h2>
          <img src="{{site.image_path}}/resources/post-clocks.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Before social media, bulling was limited to school hours, but now bullying is a non-stop torment for a lot of kids.</p>

          <h2><strong>Sexting has become an epidemic</stong></h2>
          <img src="{{site.image_path}}/resources/post-sexting.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Kids are growing faster than ever, and sexting has become an epidemic. Unfortunately, the consequences of sexting can be disastrous.</p>

          <h2><strong>Missteps can have permenant consequences</stong></h2>
          <img src="{{site.image_path}}/resources/post-danger.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Social media doesn't come with a filter, which means kids are exposed to profanity, talk of drug use and aggressive language.</p>


          <h2><strong>What can you do?</stong></h2>
          <p><strong>Educate kids:</strong>  The first step is to educate kids about how to be responsible online.  Kids need to know about the consequences of sexting, how to spot a predatory behavior, how to steer clear of profanity and how to speak respectfully.  Allowing kids to use social apps before educating them is a lot like throwing them in the deep end of the pool before teaching them how to swim.</p>
          <p><strong>Give kids a safe alternative:</strong>  With Pryvy's free group communication apps, your church can create a safe, private online community for kids to share, learn and feel connected to their community.</p>

          <p class="padding-b-20">Pryvy's protected apps also give kids a safe environment for learning how to be responsible online.<p>
