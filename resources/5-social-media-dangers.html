          <h1 class="post-header">Social Media Dangers: 5 Things every parent should know</h1>
          <img src="https://d1gdmj0r4mf4is.cloudfront.net/images/resources/post-social-dangers.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Social apps like Instagram and Twitter are powerful tools for both good and bad.  On the one hand, they connect us to the world, and allow us to feely share ideas and thoughts.  On the other hand, they put us face-to-face with the dark side of humanity.  </p>
          <p>As adults, we know how to use social media responsibly (most of the time), but kids and young teens aren't mature enough to know how to keep themselves safe or to process the adult content that is pervasive on social sites.</p>
          <p>It's no wonder the mix of kids and social media can have disasterous consequences.  Here are 5 social media dangers that every parent should be aware of:</p>  

          <h2><strong>5. Constant Contact with Strangers</strong></h2>
          <img src="https://d1gdmj0r4mf4is.cloudfront.net/images/resources/post-strangers.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>The internet is incredibly powerful, and through social apps we can chat with anyone regardless of distance.  Unfortunately, kids are often too young to know the difference between well-meaning strangers, and those with less honerable intentions.</p>

<h2>Oversharing</h2>
<p>One of the most common mistakes kids make is oversharing.  They don't realize information posted online is visible to anyone and everyone, and this can lead to security &amp; safety issues.</p>
<p>Teach kids to think twice about everything they post. <strong>Would they post this on a billboard?</strong></p>

<h2>Online Predators</h2>
<p>As more and more kids go online, more and more predators are using social sites to find them.  In fact, <strong>65% of online predators</strong> use social networks to find home &amp; school information about their victims.</p>

          <h2 style="padding-top:30px;"><strong>4. Pervasive Profanity</strong></h2>
          <img src="https://d1gdmj0r4mf4is.cloudfront.net/images/resources/post-profanity.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Social media doesn't come with a filter, which means kids are exposed to foul and agressive language at every turn.</p>
<h2>Who are kids following?</h2>
<p>Sites like Instagram &amp; Twitter have made celebrities much more accessable, but not all celebrities are the good role models.  Some post pictures of drug use, less than modest outfits and aren't shy about using adult lanuage.</p>

<h2>Online Gaming Chats</h2>
<p>Many parents don't realize that when their kids play connected video games online or through a console like XBox, they can chat with other players from around the world.  In violent video game situations, the language players use becomes agressive and profanity-ridden.  Studies have shown that exposure to this language at a young age causes kids to become more agressive in the real world.</p>

          <h2 style="padding-top:30px;"><strong>3. Bullying is now a constant torment</strong></h2>
          <img src="https://d1gdmj0r4mf4is.cloudfront.net/images/resources/post-clocks.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>20 years ago bullying as limited to school hours, but between text messaging and social media bullying has become a non-stop torment for a lot kids.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>Before bullying even becomes an issue, make sure your child knows that they can be open about any harassment they face online.  If it does become an issue, be sure to cut off the harasser by blocking them online or by blocking their cell phone number.</p>

          <h2 style="padding-top:30px;"><strong>2. Sexting has become an epidemic</strong></h2>
          <img src="https://d1gdmj0r4mf4is.cloudfront.net/images/resources/post-sexting.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>One of the most tragic outcomes of early social media use is the rise of sexting among 12-17 year-olds.  The consequences of sexting can be devastating for both boys and girls.</p>

<h2>Mental Health Issues</h2>
<p>Young girls are often pressured into sharing pictures of themselves over Snapchat or text with boys either their own age or much older.  While that is bad enough, these images get drawn on and passed around within schools, and eventually find their way to the world wide web, where they will live forever.  It's not hard to imagine how devastating this can be for a young girls. </p> 

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>
<p>Another consequence that tweens and teens aren't aware of is that by sharing these pictures online they can face felony child pornography charges, and prosecutors aren't shy about charging kids with these crimes.</p>

          <h2 style="padding-top:30px;"><strong>1. Missteps can have permenant consequences</strong></h2>
          <img src="https://d1gdmj0r4mf4is.cloudfront.net/images/resources/post-danger.png" width="100%" class="padding-b-20">
          <p>Kids say some off-the-wall things, and usually that's ok. In the real world parents, friends and relatives can let kids know that what they said is inappropriate.  The online world is much different.  Saying something inappropriate online will almost always find its way to authorities who can take legal against your child.</p>

<h2>Sarah and the FBI</h2>
<p>One of the most widely know examples of this was the case of Sarah from the Netherlands.  Like many teens she has a wacky sense of humor and sent this tweet to American Airlines: "hello my name's Ibrahim and I'm from Afghanistan. I'm part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I'm gonna do something really big bye."
<img src="http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aa-tweet.jpg" width="100%"><br>American Airlines didn't share her brand of humor, and Sarah was eventually taken into custody.  </p>
